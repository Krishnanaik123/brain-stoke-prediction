# brain-stoke-prediction
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a brain stroke using patient health data. The prediction models are built using popular machine learning algorithms such as:

 Decision Tree, Random Forest,Hybrid Model (combination approach)
 Accepts patient data like age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, etc.

Predicts the probability of a brain stroke

Compares accuracy between multiple models

Clean and simple Python code (Jupyter Notebook / .py)

Visualizations included (optional)

1️.Decision Tree
A tree-structured classifier that splits the dataset based on feature values for straightforward prediction.

2️.Random Forest
An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

3️.Hybrid Model
A custom model combining predictions from both decision tree and random forest using majority voting or probability averaging for better accuracy.
Random Forest Accuracy: 95.2%
Decision Tree Accuracy: 91.4%
Hybrid Model Accuracy: 96.3%
